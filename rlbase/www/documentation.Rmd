**RLBase** is a web database for **accessing and exploring standardized R-loop mapping data from > 600 publicly-available samples**. Key features:

1. Explore hundreds of R-loop mapping datasets
2. Explore R-loop regions (sites of consensus R-loop formation)
3. Analyze your own R-loop mapping data
4. Download processed and standardized data sets.

*RLBase* is a core component of [**RLSuite**](https://gccri.bishop-lab.uthscsa.edu/rlsuite/){target="_blank"}, an R-loop analysis software toolchain. **RLSuite** also includes [RLPipes](https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLPipes){target="_blank"} (a CLI pipeline for upstream R-loop data processing), [RLSeq](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLSeq/){target="_blank"} (R package for downstream R-loop data analysis), and [RLHub](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLHub/){target="_blank"} (R package interface to the RLBase data store).

Our goal in this document is to **(1) Describe the backround and motivation of RLBase, (2) showcase the intended usage of RLBase, and (3) address FAQs which may arise when using RLBase**.

# Background and Motivation

## R-Loops and R-loop mapping

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed from the hybridization of RNA and DNA, typically during transcription. R-loops have long been studied in the context of pathology, but recent evidence indicates that play a crucial (albeit poorly understood) role in normal cell physiology [@Niehrs2020].

![Depiction of an R-loop and the factors which may promote them (Hegazy et al., 2020; PMID: [31843970](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31843970/){target="_blank"})](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/R-loop_promoting_factors.jpg){align="right" style="border: none; float: none;" width="560"}

With the advent of DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (DRIP-Seq) in 2012, it become possible to map R-loop locations throughout the genome [@Ginno2012]. In the years since, dozens of studies have implemented R-loop mapping approaches and submitted their data to public repositories like the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

## The RLBase project (est. 2019)

We began the *RLBase* project in 2019 with the aim of standardizing public R-loop mapping samples and making the resulting data accessible for R-loop biologists to explore and analysis. Our first publication from this project used over 100 DRIP-Seq data-sets to reveal an unexpected role for physiological R-loops in chromatin architecture [@Pan2020]. Building on this pilot study, we began in 2020 to manually catalog **all** public R-loop mapping samples, finding \> 40 studies and \> 600 data sets. We developed and implemented a light-weight CLI pipeline, [RLPipes](https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLPipes){target="_blank"}, to standardize the re-processing of these data from raw reads.

Unexpectedly, **we found drastic inconsistency in sample data quality, posing a major hurdle to meta-analysis and exploration of these data**, echoing the findings of *Chedin et al., 2021* [@Ch√©din2021] found in their meta-analysis.

To overcome this limitation, we developed new methods for assessing sample quality (implemented in the [RLSeq](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLSeq/){target="_blank"} R package). We implemented an online-learning scheme and developed an ensemble ML model which accurately categorizes R-loop data sets as "POS" (robustly maps R-loops) or "NEG" (poorly maps R-loops) (see [model documentation](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLHub/reference/models.html#details){target="_blank"}). By excluding the "NEG" samples, we derived a high-confidence sample set for meta-analysis. In our first meta-analysis, we identified R-loop regions (RL Regions), sites of consensus R-loop formation. We also analyzed the correlation between R-loop signal and expression within RL Regions. These data can be explored in the "RL Regions" panel of "RLBase".

-   Exploration of R-loop mapping samples ([view](#rlsamples))
    -   Exploration of mapping samples from different modalities
    -   Analysis of sample quality
    -   Analysis of genomic feature enrichment
-   R-loop Region (RL Region) analysis ([link](#rlregions))

## Analysis of RLBase samples {#rlsamples}

The samples in RLBase were standardized and reprocessed using the [*RLPipes*](https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLPipes){target="_blank"} CLI tool. They were then analyzed with [*RLSeq*](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLSeq/){target="_blank"} which performed R-loop forming sequences analysis, predict sample quality, analyze genomic feature enrichment, and to calculate their overlap with R-loop regions (RL Regions). The metadata from these analyses along with other sample information are provided in the sample data table and can be explored interactively (**Figure 1**).

## Exploration of R-loop regions {#rlregions}

R-loop regions (RL regions) are sites of consensus R-loop formation as determined through a meta-analysis of all high-confidence RLBase samples. For greater detail on how RL Regions were derived, please see the relevant section of the [RLHub documentation](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLHub/reference/rlregions.html#source){target="_blank"}. The RLBase "RL Regions" page provides a simple interface for exploring these data (**Figure 7**). RL regions have a variety of metadata associated with them, such as the number of samples in which they are found and the genes which they overlap with (**Figure 8**). Finally, the Spearman correlation between RL Region signal (as determined from high-confidence RLBase samples) and expression (as determined by paired-RNA-Seq data) is also shown (**Figure 8**). 

![**Figure 7.**. The "R-loop Regions" page. R-loop regions ("RL Regions"; consensus sites of R-loop formation) are described in greater detail in the [RLHub documentation](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLHub/reference/rlregions.html#source){target="_blank"}. This page provides an interface for exploring these data. (A) Controls for altering the data shown in (B). "All genes", if selected, forces (B) to also show pseudogenes, RNA genes, and predicted genes. If "Repetitive" is selected, RL Regions that overlap with repetitive elements will be displayed. If "Correlated with expression" is selected, only the RL Regions with significant correlation between R-loop signal and expression will be shown. (B) The table of RL Regions along with metadata. The RL Regions in this table are controlled by (A) and selecting rows will impact the output in (C).

## Analysis of user-supplied data {#userdata}

The analysis methods developed in [RLSeq](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLSeq/index.html){target="_blank"} allow for the analysis of R-loop mapping samples within the context of the publicly-available data stored in RLBase. However, an R-package implementation may not be suitable for all users. To help increase access to these methods, RLBase provides an in-browser option for running RLSeq in the "Analyze" tab. The interface and usage are decribed below.

![**Figure 9.**. The "Analyze" page allows users to analyze an R-loop mapping sample in the browser. (A) Inputs describing the R-loop mapping sample. It is recommended to lift-over your data to "hg38" or "mm10" if possible, as RLSeq is most compatible with these genomes. For an explanation of the "Mode" and "Label", please see the [terminology section](#terminology). (B) An upload input for the peaks to analyze (should be in [broadPeak format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format13){target="_blank"} if possible (narrowPeak and BED can also be used, but may produce unexpected results). (C) The user must also acknowledge the privacy statement, which specifies that uploaded data will be made publicly available in the analysis results link.](https://rlbase-data.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/assets/rlbase_interface/analyze_page.png){align="right" style="border: none; float: none;"}

# FAQs

This section attempts to answer some of the questions which may arise during the usage of *RLBase*. The types of questions are divided based on the general category which they fill into:

1. **Terminology**: Terms and concepts used within *RLBase*.
2. **Bugs**: Describes handling of erros and bugs.
3. **License and citation**: Describes attribution and license.

## Terminology

In this subsection, we describe the terminology used in *RLBase* to help aid in its usage.

### Modes

RLBase contains R-loop mapping data from high-throughput sequencing experiments. There are, to date, over 20 different methods of R-loop mapping included in *RLBase*. To help summarize them, we have provided the following visualization:

```{r, fig.cap="Diagram showing the different R-loop mapping methods which exist. All of these are found in RLBase (except computational methods, SMRF-Seq, and bisDRIP-Seq).", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("R-loop mapping methods (primary div)@2x.png")
```

For additional detail, please refer to the following summary table:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://rlbase-data.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/rlbase_catalog.xlsx", destfile = tmp, quiet = TRUE)
readxl::read_excel(tmp, sheet = 5) %>%
  mutate(PMID = ifelse(is.na(PMID), "", PMID),
         PMID = map_chr(PMID, makePubMedLinks)) %>%
  knitr::kable(escape = FALSE, caption = "R-loop mapping modes and associated metadata.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE)
```

Column description: 

* **mode**: The R-loop mapping modality. 
* **family**: The broad classification of that mode. 
* **ip_type**: The type of immunoprecipitation (IP) used in the mapping protocol. 'S9.6' for S9.6 antibody-based IP. 'dRNH' for 'catalytically dead RNaseH1' IP. 'None' if no IP was used.
* **strand_specific**: A boolean indicating whether the mode is strand-specific or not.
* **moeity**: Indicates the moeity that was sequenced.
* **bisulfite_seq**: A boolean indicating whether the mode uses bisulfite conversion sequencing.
* **PMID**: The pubmed ID for the study in which this method was first described. 

### Sample Condition

Sample condition was added manually during initial data curation based on the metadata in [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds){target="_blank"} and/or [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra){target="_blank"}. The condition refers to the R-loop mapping condition of the sample. For example, a condition of "Input" represents a genomic input sample that would be a negative control in R-loop mapping. 

#### Label

The label is the simplication the sample condition into two categories: "POS" or "NEG". "POS" indicates a sample condition which is expected to map R-loops. "NEG" indicates a negative control which is not expected to map R-loops. In DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (DRIP), for example, "S9.6" indicates a "POS" condition which should map R-loops, where as "RNH1" (RNaseH1-treated) indicates a "NEG" condition which should not as RNaseH1 is an enzyme that degrades R-loops. The label was automatically assigned to each sample using a custom REGEX dictionary applied to the sample condition:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://rlbase-data.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/rlbase_catalog.xlsx", destfile = tmp, quiet = TRUE)
readxl::read_excel(tmp, sheet = 4) %>%
  mutate(NEG = NEG | `NULL`) %>% select(-`NULL`) %>%
  knitr::kable(escape = FALSE, caption = "R-loop mapping modes and associated metadata.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE)
```


#### Prediction

While a sample may have a "POS" label, that does not mean it mapped R-loops. Likewise sampels with "NEG" label sometimes robustly mapped R-loops, as may be the case when RNaseH1 treatment fails during DRIP sequencing. This finding motivated us to develop the quality model used in RLSeq (see documentation about this model [here](https://bishop-laboratory.github.io/RLHub/reference/models.html#details){target="_blank"}). The model predicts either "POS" or "NEG", which indicates robust R-loop mapping and poor R-loop mapping, respectively.

## Bugs

RLBase is still young in its devleopment cycle, which means bugs may occasionally occur. If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLBase/issues/) on the RLBase github repo and describe, in as much detail as possible, the following:

1. What you expected RLBase to do.
2. What RLBase did.
3. Any error messages you recieved (along with screenshots).
4. If analyzing your own data, please also include a link to the dataset (if it can be shared).

## License and attribution

RLBase is licensed under an MIT license, which means there is no restriction on use for any purpose. However, we ask that you please cite RLBase in any published work like so:
